 The hyperComponents library is for instructional purposes.   The goal is to expose the community to actual source code for hypermedia exchanges and to emphasize the advantages of hypermedia versus  JSON exchanges for building modern Web UIs.

 `There are no restrictions on usage` of the code examples provided here.   

As most web developers today are using a JavaScript framework for front-end development and a Node.js or Python backend, we have apoint to make that the tooling used here has many of the same capabilities at a lower cost in bandwith, speed, and learning curve.  Plus, all hyperComponents in this library avoid data exchange to update the UI. The examples illustrate how easy and straight forward (and powerful) it is return hypermedia responses instead of JSON. 

The code examples are rather basic and underpowered for most real web projects.  That is obvious and we know that.  Plus, there are tons of other use cases not covered here.  But that deficit is just an invitation for you to build your own solutions using the techniques you learn from the hyperComponents code.

 You should just consider the code provided here  as a springboard for your application needs.   We encourage you to customize and refactor any of our examples.

This is an instructional site.   Review the example code.  Do something fun.  Make cool software.

Thanks for your interest,

Mark M Levinson, MD
Lead Author, hyperComponents

## Cost

There is no cost for any offerings on this site.   Just copy/paste the examples and make your own changes.  Everything if free of charge.

## Restrictions

There are none.  You may use any code from the hyperComponents library in any project of your choosing, whether personal, for profit, or commercial.

## Duplication

You are free to duplicate the code, make changes, and redistribute.   We ask that you link to the hyperComponents web site and credit the authors here when you use any components in your project.


## Contributing

The code base for hyperComponents can be reached by clicking on the go to [github]( https://github.com/mmlevinson/hyperComponents) link on the splash screen.

If you want to make changes (bug fixes?) or contribute a new example of hypermedia using the same tools (Astro, HTMX, HyperScript) then send a pull request and offer to join the project as a contributor.   The project is public and Open Source. We welcome contributors with instructional code examples that illustrate the advantages of hypermedia exchanges in modern web development.

This library uses a certain 'style' of writing, both for the docs and the code.  When you review the code examples, they will not be organized in the manner that you code. Well, maybe because no two persons code exactly the same....  ;-)

 For example there are few to no comments.   This is because HyperScript and HTMX strive to be self documenting and self explanatory in keeping with the Locality of Behavior strategy.  

Your PR will be reviewed not only for content but for coding style.   Expect that your  code would be refactored to bring the coding style more in line with the styles you see in existing examples.   This would only be done to maintain a consistent 'look and feel' of the examples, especially for beginners who are learning the principles from reading our source code examples. (Afterall, if you are an expert in these tools, you won't be hanging out here in the first place !!).
