The code examples here are intended to be instructive of hypermedia exchanges and the use of HyperScript for client side functionality.   

The examples are basic and primitive on purpose.   The purpose is to demonstrate how htmx, HyperScript, Tailwind and Astro deliver a responsive and interactive
experience based solely on hypermedia exchanges.   

Providing an open source library is intended to begin the discussion and exposure of these tools, not as an end product for use in production.active

These examples are not solely from the library authors.   Most of the examples are either direct implementations of other example code on public sites (maybe the addition of styling using Tailwind).   When possible, the original source code is linked in the example description.active

As always, there are more than one way to do anyting, and hyperComponents are no exception.   Feel free to critique, ammend, or even rewrite any example code provided here. active
The purpose of this project is to provide a starting point for developers wanting to utilize hypermedia for state and reactivity in their web project.

Below are listed the most common sources for examples used in this project:
