The code examples here are intended to be instructive of hypermedia exchanges and the use of client side scripting with HyperScript. This project exists to provide a starting point for developers interested in using purely hypermedia for state and reactivity in their web project.   

The examples are basic and primitive on purpose.   The goal is to demonstrate how htmx, HyperScript, Tailwind and Astro deliver a responsive and interactive experience based solely on hypermedia exchanges.   

Providing an open source library is intended to begin the discussion and exposure of these tools, not as an end product for use in production.

These examples are not solely the product of the library authors or their creativity.   Most of the examples are either direct implementations of other example code on public sites (maybe with the addition of Tailwind styling).   When possible, the original source code and authors credit is linked in the example description.

As always, there are more than one way to do anything, and hyperComponents are no exception.   Feel free to critique, ammend, or even rewrite any example code provided here.   active

Is there a better way to solve the same problem than the examples provided here?   Yes, certainly.   If you prefer a different way to solve the same issue, write some code and send a Pull Request.    Glad to see what you think.
