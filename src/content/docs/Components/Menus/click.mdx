### Description

A commonly used web component is a a simple button presenting a list of choices when tapped.

The example below demonstrates an Astro component appearing as a simple button configured by a list of menu items passed into the default slot.

export const tw = {
	dropdownContainer: 'w-full py-2 w-max-lg text-center mx-auto dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-xl my-6',
	menuItem: 'px-4 hover:bg-stone-200 hover:dark:bg-stone-300 ' +
	'hover:text-cyan-100 hover:dark:text-sky-950',
}

export const hs = "on click call alert('You selected ' + my innerHTML) "

import DropdownMenu from '../../../../components/DropdownMenu.astro';

<div id='dropdownContainer' class={tw.dropdownContainer} >

<DropdownMenu id={'dropdown-example-1'} caption="Click Me" duration="300ms" moveOver="-5, -7">
   <li class={tw.menuItem} script={hs}>Choice 1</li>
   <li class={tw.menuItem} script={hs}>Choice 2</li>
   <li class={tw.menuItem} script={hs}>Choice 3</li>
   <li class={tw.menuItem} script="on click trigger closeDropdown then settle then go to url '/' ">Go Home</li>
</DropdownMenu>
</div>


The initial height of the dropdown wrapping div is set to 0 so the items cannot be seen.  The button listens for a click event which causes the dropdown  to smoothly appear by transitioning it's height and opacity over a specified duration. 

Tapping any item in the dropdown triggers a custom event to be fired followed by dismissal of the dropdown.

### Features

The trigger button and dropdown are initally styled with Tailwind CSS utility classes but are both fully customizable using props (see below)

Appearance and disappearance of the dropdown are smoothly animated by HyperScript. The dropdown is dismissed by:

###### 1. Tapping the trigger button again
###### 2. Tapping outside the dropdown
###### 3. Tapping any menu item
###### 4. Pressing the Escape key

Custom events and styling can be specified for each menu item.  In this example events triggered by tapping a menu item were written in HyperScript or htmx.


### Styling

Tailwind classes are used for the default styling of the trigger button and dropdown wrapper. For accesssibility, the trigger button receives a focus ring when activated.

To reduce verbosity and improve readability the Tailwind classes are extracted from the markup and encapsulated into a local <strong>tw</strong> variable in the Astro component script and then interpolated into the template.

Custom styles can be applied to all elements of the component by passing a string containing Tailwind utility classes as props.



### Props

```ts
interface Props {
 id:string 
 caption:string   
 dropdownStyles:string   
 buttonStyles:string   
 listStyles:string   
 moveOver:string 
 duration: string
}

const {id, caption, dropdownStyles, buttonStyles, listStyles, moveOver = "0,0", duration = '100ms'} = Astro.props
```
