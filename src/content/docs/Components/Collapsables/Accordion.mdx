A commonly used interface component is an Accordion.   The user sees a list of titles with an icon opposite the title text which prompts the user to explore by clicking on the header.  Clicking on the header transitions additional content down below the header.  

An example Accordion control written in Hyperscript is shown below.


export const tw = {
	exampleContainer: 'not-content w-full pb-4 w-max-lg text-center mx-auto bg-gray-300 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-xl my-6',
	exampleTitle: 'bg-gray-300 dark:bg-sky-900 text-gray-300 dark:text-zinc-200 font-semibold py-2 mb-4 rounded-t-xl',
	menuItem: 'px-4 hover:bg-stone-200 hover:dark:bg-stone-300 ' +
	'hover:text-cyan-100 hover:dark:text-sky-800',
	icon:'inline-block size-6',
	image: 'inline-block max-h-6',
	p: 'pb-3'	
}

## Description

 An icon (usually opposite the header caption) rotates to indicate the state of the accordion. Accordions conserve screen real estate while allowing considerable content to be displayed when needed.

From a programming standpoint, the key is calculating the content height of the accordion body.   The height of the accordion body is initially set to 0.  In response to a click event, the accordion smoothly transitions to an open state by setting a height and a transition animation.

However, massive content in the accordion body will cause a huge shift in the remaining page content.  Thus, a max-height of the accordion body should be set, and if the content exceeds this max-height value, then the remaining content should be set the scroll vertically.

The following is a brief example of an Accordion with lorem ipsum content in the body.

## Features

This Accordion hyperComponent

1.  Clicking the header toggles the body open and closed.
4.  An icon indicator turns 180 degrees to indicate open/closed state
2.  Body content is animated smoothly using a Hyperscript transition
3.  A max-height value for the Accordion body can be set by props
5.  Tailwind classes for the header, body, and active header (when opened) can be passed into the AccordionGroup_A component to style the entire component from outside.
6.  Content for the Accordion body is passed into the default slot and thus can be styled where it is used. 

## Components

The AccordionGroup_A component wraps a list of AccordionItem_A components.  The AccordionItem_A component is responsible for managing the open/closed state of each individual accordion.

##  Usage

Accordion controls are often used in FAQ or Info sections of a web site.  The advantages of using an Accordion is to hide the majority of the content until the user needs to see it.  By just presenting the content title in the header the user is prompted to explore the content by clicking on the header.   Meanwhile, the extra text in the body of the Accordion is hidden until requested.

This, of course, makes Accordions an ideal choice for lazy loading content. To enhance the UX, content for the Accordion body does not need to be loaded until selected by the user.   Using HTMX, lazy loading is easily done by listening for the click event and then reaching out to the server for html which is loaded into the Accordion body.   The transition animation is done in response to the htmx:load event.
