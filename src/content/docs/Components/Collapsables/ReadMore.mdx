	{/* Introduction */}
Blog sites typically use a ReadMore control to display a short introductory prompt followed by  a Read More... link which loads the remaining post content on demand.
		 
## Example
		 
export const tw = {
		exampleContainer: 'not-content w-full pb-4 w-max-lg bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-xl my-6',
		exampleTitle:'text-center bg-sky-900 text-gray-300 dark:text-zinc-50 font-semibold py-2 mb-4 rounded-t-xl',
		icon:'inline-block size-6',
		image: 'inline-block max-h-6',
		p: 'pb-3'	,
		intro: 'ml-2 mt-2 text-lg'
}

	{/* Example Control in Action */}
## Description
	{/* General Description */}

	A `ReadMore` control presents a short introductory text block followed by a clickable "Read More" link which reveals the remaining content in an expandable block below the introduciton.
	
	Blog sites are the most common hosts for `ReadMore` controls.   Multiple blog posts can be displayed on one page using ReadMore items.   Each post is introduced with an opening title sentence, often containing the author and posting date.   The remaining content is hidden from view until the user clicks the "Read More" link, at which point the content is revealed.

	The action of a ReadMore controls is very similar to an Accordion control.   The main difference is the button which reveals the hidden content is placed after the introductory text.   Also, an alternative caption is displayed when the content is revealed, for example 'Read Less...'.   A twirl icon rotates when opened which offers further confirmation that  hidden content is now being displayed.

	ReadMore controls allow the developer to place multiple blog posts or other titles onto a page while conserving vertical real estate.   The users is still able to access the full text of each post or article by simple clicking.

	For this example, two Astro component  are used (ReadMoreGroup_A and ReadMoreItem_A).   The ReadMoreGroup_A provides a wrapper `<ul>` and a default slot for passing in multiple ReadMoreItems.  
	
	The introductory text is placed into the components default slot of the item component.   An `id` and `path` values are passed as props.  When the user clicks or hovers over the trigger button, the additional content is lazy-loaded using a fetch to the designated api route with the `id` being the `slug` to retrieve the correct data.   When the user  clicks on the trigger button an  event transitions the body elements height from 0 to a calculated height value over the specified duration.

	The basic source code to implement the examples  is shown below.   The [code](#code) section below contains the props, scripts, and styling of both Astro components.   In order to use this ReadMore example, You will need to set up analagous [custom API endpoints](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/endpoints/) and return appropriate html responses but the example code should help you get started.

## Features

This ReadMore Control hides the majority of a blog post or article while presenting a short summary inviting the user to click the trigger button to review more content.  

1.  The trigger button caption and alternative caption can be sent as props
2.  The maximum height of the exposed content can be adjusted via props
3.  The transition duration is customizable
4.  Styling for the ReadMore flex container, trigger button, and twirl icon can be customized using Tailwind utility classes passed via props
5.  A custom twirl icon can be used


		 
## Components
	{/* Breakdown of each Astro Components used for this control */}

### ReadMoreGroup_A

This component provides a general `<ul>` wrapper around multiple ReadMoreItem_A components.  This wrapper then permits the developer to style the entire group, especially with positioning utility classes.  

In additon, a HyperScript in the group component listens for the `closeOtherReadMores` event and then sends the closeUp event to all other ReadMoreItems if the `closeSiblings` prop is true.

See the [Code](#code) section below for a full breakdown of the ReadMoreGroup_A component.

#### Props
	{/* Each component, with code block showing the props interface */}

```js

interface Props {
	closeSiblings?: boolean 
	styles?: string  
}

const {
	closeSiblings = true,
	styles
} = Astro.props


```

		##### closeSiblings

		This boolean value controls whether or not the ReadMoreGroup_A component should close other ReadMoreItems when one is opened.  The default is true.

		##### styles

		This prop allows the developer to pass in any Tailwind CSS utility classes to style the ReadMoreGroup_A component.   Most useful classes for the group component are positioning, margins, padding, and the like.

#### Slots

	##### default slot

	Multiple ReadMoreItem_A components can be passed into the default slot of the ReadMoreGroup_A component.

#### Events

	##### closeOtherReadMores

	This event is fired during the openUp event.   You can opt in to listen for this event in the parent `<ul>` which wraps all your ReadMoreItem_A components.  If you follow the code in the [Example](#example) above, a local constant can be used to set whether to opt in or out.


### ReadMoreItem_A

The heart of this control is in the ReadMoreItem_A component.  This component provides a single `<li>` wrapper around both the introductory text and the hidden content.  T

The introductory text is passed into the components default slot.  This strategy allows you to put any amount and any styling you wish into the introductory text. 

Hidden content is lazy-loaded using the fetch command in the accompanying HyperScript.    An `id` and `path` values are passed as props.  For this example, the `id` prop also serves the file `slug` which is concatenated to the `path` to form a valid api enpoint and retrieve the correct hypermedia response from the backend. 

Review the Scripts tab in the [Code](#code) section below for the HyperScript used to implement the hidden content lazy-load.

#### Props

```js

interface Props {
	id:string   
	path?:string	
	caption?:string	
	altCaption?:string	
	maxHeight?:number	 
	duration?:string	
	readMoreStyles?:string	
	buttonStyles?:string
	iconStyles?:string	
	bodyStyles?:string	
}

```

	##### id

		Each ReadMoreItem_A consists of a `<li>` which in turn encloses a flex container and a div.  

		The flex container hold both the trigger button and the twirl-icon.

		Each item should be given a unique id serves the dual purpose of preventing name collisions with other ReadMoreItem's as well as providing the final `slug` for the file path where the content will be fetched.   If you are using a backend database, the id could be the record identifier as well.


	##### path

	This prop carries the route to the api endpoint where the content will be fetched.   String concatenation in the HyperScript builds the final route using both `id` and the `path` values.

	##### caption

	The string value passed in the `caption` prop is the initial text content of the trigger button when the body content is hidden.   The default caption is 'Read More...'


	##### altCaption

	The string value pass in the `altCaption` prop is displayed as the text content of the trigger button when the body content is fully displayed.   This text should encourage the user to click again to hide the content.    

	The default `altCaption` is 'Read Less....'


	##### maxHeight

	The body content of the ReadMore is clipped to a fixed height, beyound which the content scrolls vertically.

	The default value is 500.   The underlying units used by the script code is pixels.   This prop accespts a number so a mathematical comparison can be performed to determine if the content exceeds the maxHeight value.


	##### duration

	This props accepts a string indicating the timing of the transition for showing and hiding the body content of the ReadMoreItem.


	##### readMoreStyles

	The trigger button and twirl-icon are wrapped by a single flex container.  You can set the background, height, hover etc styles by sending in additional TW classes to the readMoreStyles prop.


	##### buttonStyles

	Use this prop to individually style the trigger button.


	##### iconStyles

	Use this prop to individually style the twirl-icon.

	##### bodyStyles

	This prop can be used to provide general styles to the container where the body content is displayed.  Some of those styles will also be inherited to the actual text of the content, as per usual with CSS inheritance.   For example, text-color TW classes will apply to `<p>` tags within the content.   


#### Slots
	{/* Outline the name/function of each slot */}
	##### default
The default slot is used to place the introductory text for the ReadMore item.   The introductory text is placed into the components default slot.   An `id` and `path` values are passed as props.  When the user clicks or hovers on the ReadMore text, the remaining content is lazy-loaded in to the body element of the component.   Then, a click event transitions the body elements height from 0 to a calculated height value over the specified duration.

	##### twirl-icon

The default icon which rotates 180 degrees is a down-caret SVG.   You can override the icon by placing a custom SVG in the `<slot name='twirl-icon'>`.

In order for the rotation behavior to work, you must also encode the id of the svg exactly as `twirl-icon-${id}` (enclosed in back-ticks).  This identifier will then be picked up by the Hyperscript and the .rotate-180 toggled when the openUp or closeUp events are triggered.

#### Events

	##### openUp

	The ReadMoreItem_A component listens for the openUp event and then recalculates the height of the body element.  Also the .rotate-180 class is added to the twirl icon and the trigger button text is replaced with the string passed into the `altCaption` prop.

	##### closeUp

	The ReadMoreItem_A component listens for the closeUp event sets the body height to zero,  removes the .rotate-180 class from the twirl icon, and replaces the trigger button text with the string passed into the `caption` prop.





## Styling
To improve readability, the Tailwind classes and Hyperscripts are both extracted from the markup and encapsulated into  Astro `tw` and `hs` local variables within the [Component Script](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/#the-component-script) which are then referenced in the html markup. 
		 
The advantage of this strategy is to allow long run-on strings to be formatted as concatenated, multi-line strings which aids readability and code maintenance.
