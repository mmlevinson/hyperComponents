A utility control for displaying content within separate panels is the TabPanel control.

In this example, classic rounded tabs utilize a button which retrieves a hypermedia fragment from a backend API route using htmx.    Panel switching is performed exclusively by HyperScript.   All styling is from Tailwind.

There are two Astro components used to provide this control, a TabPanel component which wraps multiple TabPanelItem components.   

You can style the active and inactive tabs using Tailwind utility classes and they will be picked up and implemented by the Hyperscript code.

		 
## Example
		 
export const tw = {
		exampleContainer: 'not-content w-full w-max-lg text-center mx-auto bg-gray-300 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-xl my-6',
		exampleTitle: 'bg-gray-300 dark:bg-sky-900 text-gray-300 dark:text-zinc-200 font-semibold py-2 mb-4 rounded-t-xl',
		icon:'inline-block size-6',
		image: 'inline-block max-h-6',
		p: 'pb-3'	
}
		 
<div id='TabPanel-example' class={tw.exampleContainer} >
<div id='TabPanel-title' class={tw.exampleTitle}>Sample TabPanel Control</div>
	{/* Example Control in Action */}

import TabPanel from '../../../../components/tabs/TabPanel.astro'
import TabPanelItem from '../../../../components/tabs/TabPanelItem.astro'

	<div class="p-4">
		<TabPanel defaultTabId="1">
			<TabPanelItem id="0" caption="Hypermedia" path="/api/readmore/0" trigger="load, click" />
			<TabPanelItem id="1" caption="HTMX" path="/api/readmore/1" />
			<TabPanelItem id="2" caption="Tailwind" path="/api/readmore/2" />
			<TabPanelItem id="3" caption="Hyperscript" path="/api/readmore/3" />
			<TabPanelItem id="4" caption="Astro" path="/api/readmore/4" />
		</TabPanel>
	</div>


</div>

## Components
	{/* Breakdown of each Astro Components used for this control */}
	### TabPanel
   
	  The main container for this control is the `TabPanel` component.

		Included in the TabPanel component is a tw constant containing all the base styles for both the container, the `<output/>` panel, and the individual TabPanelItems visible at the top of the control.

		Exporting the tw constant allows for sharing key styles between the hyperscript code within the container and the tabs themselves.  In order to switch the appearance of the Tabs when activated, the styles must be available to both the container which harbors the Hyperscript code for switching tabs and the individual tab components themselves.  This is done by simply exporting a tw constant from the container and importing it into the TabPanelItem component where some of the utility classes are used to style the tabs themselves.

		

		#### Props
			{/* Each component, with code block showing the props interface */}
		#### Styling
		To improve readability, the Tailwind classes and Hyperscripts are both extracted from the markup and encapsulated into  Astro `tw` and `hs` local variables within the [Component Script](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/#the-component-script) which are then referenced in the html markup. 
			
		The advantage of this strategy is to allow long run-on strings to be formatted as concatenated, multi-line strings which aids readability and code maintenance.
