A utility control for displaying blocks of related content is the TabPanel control.

In the example below, a row of classic semi-rounded Tabs is presented above a fixed height container where content is loaded according to the topic displayed in the Tab.  
		 
## Example
		 
export const tw = {
		exampleContainer: 'not-content w-full w-max-lg text-center my-6 mx-auto rounded-xl ' + 
		'bg-gray-300 dark:bg-gray-800' ,
		exampleTitle: 'py-2 mb-4 rounded-t-xl ' + 
		'font-semibold text-gray-300 dark:text-zinc-200 ' + 
		'bg-gray-800 dark:bg-sky-900 ',
		icon:'inline-block size-6',
		image: 'inline-block max-h-6',
		p: 'pb-3'	
}
		 
<div id='TabPanel-example' class={tw.exampleContainer} >
<div id='TabPanel-title' class={tw.exampleTitle}>Sample TabPanel Control</div>
	{/* Example Control in Action */}

import TabPanel from '../../../../components/tabs/TabPanel.astro'
import TabPanelItem from '../../../../components/tabs/TabPanelItem.astro'

	<div class="p-4">
		<TabPanel defaultTabId="1">
			<TabPanelItem id="0" caption="Hypermedia" path="/api/readmore/0" trigger="load, click" />
			<TabPanelItem id="1" caption="HTMX" path="/api/readmore/1" />
			<TabPanelItem id="2" caption="Tailwind" path="/api/readmore/2" />
			<TabPanelItem id="3" caption="Hyperscript" path="/api/readmore/3" />
			<TabPanelItem id="4" caption="Astro" path="/api/readmore/4" />
		</TabPanel>
	</div>


</div>
		 
## Description
	{/* General Description */}
	{/* Example  Code block showing the  control in action. */}


This example hyperComponent uses [htmx](https://htmx.org) to issue AJAX requests to an [Astro](https://astro.build/docs) API endpoint which returns a [hypermedia](https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-apis-vs-data-apis/) response that is loaded into the container below the tabs.

Switching tabs is performed exclusively by [HyperScript](https://hyperscript.org).  Styling is provided only by [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) utility classes.

There are two Astro components used to implement this control, specifically  a [TabPanel](#tabpanel) component which acts as a parent container that wraps multiple [TabPanelItem](#tabpanelitem) components.  

	```astro title="UsingATabPanel.astro" "TabPanel" "TabPanelItem"

	---
import TabPanel from '/components/tabs/TabPanel.astro'
import TabPanelItem from '/components/tabs/TabPanelItem.astro'
	---
		 
<TabPanel defaultTabId="1">
		<TabPanelItem id="0" caption="Hypermedia" path="/api/endpoint/0" trigger="load, click" />
		<TabPanelItem id="1" caption="HTMX" path="/api/endpoint/1" />
		<TabPanelItem id="2" caption="Tailwind" path="/api/endpoint/2" />
		<TabPanelItem id="3" caption="Hyperscript" path="/api/endpoint/3" />
		<TabPanelItem id="4" caption="Astro" path="/api/endpoint/4" />
</TabPanel>

	```

## Features

1.  A single fixed-height panel with a top row of tabs
2.  Height of panel can be changed via props.
3.  Panel content is loaded from custom API routes using [htmx](https://htmx.org)
4.  Customizable appearance of active and inactive tabs
5.  Customizable appearance of the panel content
6.  Smooth transitions between content swapping
		 
## Components
	{/* Breakdown of each Astro Components used for this control */}
	### TabPanel
   
	  The main container for this control is the `TabPanel` component.

		The following sections break down the code with explanations for the [Props](#props), [Slots](#slots), [Events](#events), [Attributes](#attributes), and [Transitions](#transitions) provided by this component.

   All the  source code you need to implement this component in your project is presented in various tabs of the [Code](#code) section below.		

		#### Props
			{/* Each component, with code block showing the props interface */}
			
		```js title="TabPanel.astro"
		interface Props {
			defaultTabId?:string 
			maxHeight?:string  
		}
		
		const {
			defaultTabId = '0',
			maxHeight = 'max-h-[35rem]'
} = Astro.props 
		```

		##### defaultTabId

		This prop accepts a unique identifier for a single TabPanelItem.   

		The Hyperscript code in the TabPanel arent component grabs this identifier and retrieves a reference to the appropriate [TabPanelItem](#tabpanelitem).   This, in turn is sent to a  custom event to activate this one panel on page load.

		This identifier must match an identifier in one of the TabPanelItems or an error will occur. 
		
		The default value is '0'

		##### maxHeight

		This props sets the maximum height of the `<output> ` element where the content is displayed.   This should be an appropriate Tailwind `max-h` value and can include any extemporaneous value in brackets.   

		The default is `max-h-[35rem]`.


		#### Styling

		The Component Script of the TabPanel component uses  a `tw` constant to encapsulate all the base styles for the container, the  panel's `<output/>` element, as well as the individual [TabPanelItems](#tabpanelitem) displayed as tabs  at the top of the control.

		Exporting the `tw` constant allows for sharing important Tailwind classes between the markup, the Hyperscript code, and the child TabPanelItem instances.  
		
		In order to switch the appearance of a tab when activated certain Tailwind classes must be added and removed by the Hyperscript code.   If these classes were embedded into the `class` attribute of the appropriate DOM element, they would not be exposed to the Hyperscript code.    Extracting them into the `tw` constant not only consolidates the markup but also makes the classes available elsewhere inside as well as outside of the [TabPanel](#tabpanel) component.

		Another advantage of this strategy is code maintenance.  It is easier to make changes and update the styling when everything is gathered into one place, but still in proximity to the markup where it is being used (as per [Locality of Behavior](https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behavior/)).

		Below is the `tw` constant containing the entire styling code for both the container and the individual tabs.   

		```js title="TabPanel.astro" "tw"
		export const tw = {
			container: 'tab-panel flex justify-left ',
			output: 'block text-left p-4 w-full overflow-y-scroll ' +
				'bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-950 ',
			tabItem: 'z-10 tab-item select-none ' + 
				'font-semibold rounded-t-xl cursor-pointer ' + 
				'hover:bg-orange-100 dark:hover:bg-purple-900 ' +
				'border-2  border-slate-600 ',
			activeLight: 'bg-gray-100',
			activeDark: 'dark:bg-gray-950',
			inactiveLight: 'bg-slate-300',
			inactiveDark: 'dark:bg-gray-800',
			textActiveLight: 'text-blue-950',
			textActiveDark: 'dark:text-orange-200',
			textInactiveLight: 'text-blue-900',
			textInactiveDark: 'dark:text-zinc-200'
}
		```
		The `container` classes provide styling for the entire control.  A `tab-panel` class is added to the container only to make the Hyperscript aware of parent container.  

		The `output` classes provide styling for `<output>` element where the content is displayed.  You can, of course, apply any styles of your choice to the markup returned by you custom endpoints.

		To change the appearance of the active tab, you should alter  the  `activeLight`, `activeDark`, `textActiveLight` and `textActiveDark` properties  of the `tw` object.

		To change the appearance of the inactive tabs, you should likewise adjust the `inactiveLight`, `inactiveDark`, `textInactiveLight`, and `textInactiveDark` properties of the `tw` object.

		The hover effect is only present on the `tabItem` property so that is where you would adjust any hover colors you wish.

    The Hyperscript is aware of the `tw` properties and will add/remove specifi classes that exist in the `tw` properties.  If you need more customizable behaviors for the individual tabs, you will need to provide more classes to the HS code yourself.  Follow the example in the [scripts tab](#code) below to see how this was done.


		#### Slots
		{/* Outline the name/function of each slot */}

		This component contains a single  default slot which receives multiple child [TabPanelItems](#tabpanelitem) components.

		#### Events
		{/* Any custom events emitted by this component*/}

		The TabPanel component does not emit any custom events.  However, the HS code listens for the following events:
		
		##### load

		On page load, the `defaultTabId` prop is picked up by the HS code which triggers an activateTab() event passing a reference to the appropriate [TabPanelItem](#tabpanelitem)  as the argument.

		##### activateTab(tab)

		This event adds/removes classes to change the appearance of the tab which is passed as the argument.   All other tabs are then deactived by sending a deactivateSiblings event.

		##### deactivateSiblings(activeTab)

		Since only one tab can be active (and its content displayed) at a time, this event is used to revert all other tabs back to their inactive appearance by switching certain utility classes.

		The `activeTab` argument is used to to ignore the currently active tab while inactivating all  others.

		#### Attributes


   ```js  title="Attributes" "hx-trigger" "hx-swap" "hx-target"
		hx-trigger="click"
		hx-swap="innerHTML transition:true"
		hx-target="next <output/>"
	 	```

   One of the power features of htmx is [attribute inheritance](https://htmx.org/docs/#inheritance).   The majority of attributes are  available within children of the parent component where those attributes are applied.   This spreads functionality to the children without code duplication.

	 Placing the following attributes on the container `div` of the parent [TabPanel](#tabpanel) takes advantage of inheritance by providing the same attributes to all child [TabPanelItems](#tabpanelitem).

		##### hx-trigger


		The default trigger event for switching tabs is a 'click' event.  

		##### hx-swap

		The swap stragegy is simple.  The response is swapped into the innerHTML of the target (below) with  `transition:true` signalling htmx to apply the ViewTransitions API for a seamless fade effect between outgoing and incoming content.

		##### hx-target

		The TabPanel component contains a single `<output/>` element which renders the response html.   
 

		#### Transitions
		{/* Description of the animations used in the control */}

		By adding `transition:true` to the `hx-swap` attribute, the ViewTransitions API is invoked to create a smooth fade-in appearance when the panel content is switched.


		#### Code
		{/* Brief explanation of the component */}  

	 In the scripts tab below notice the use of back-ticks for the `hs` constan.  By extracting the script into a local constant and then using back-ticks with string interpolation, it is possible to embed individual TW utility classes and other props directly into the HS code while at the same time allowing the markup to utilize these same values.  

		You would not be able to  cross-purpose the styling with the HS code if you kept the TW classes inside the `class` attribute of the DOM elements themselves.

		Also note how the `maxHeight` prop is added onto the `class` attribute of the `<output/>` element by simple string concatenation.   This simple trick permits props to be used in the styling as long as you don't pass a duplicate class via props.   In this case, no default `max-h` was specified in the `tw.output` property so no collision would occur.   If need be, collisions or duplicates can be suppressed by using the `twMerge()` function illustrated in other hyperComponent examples.

	### TabPanelItem

	Each visible Tab is implemented by an instance of the TabPanelItem component.

	The essential detail is a button styled to appear as a tab by rounding the upper corners.  Clicking the button emits a custom event which Hyperscript listens for in the parent [TabPanel](#tabpanel) container.    

	#### Props

	```js
		interface Props {
			id: string 
			caption: string 
			path: string 
			trigger?: string 
		}

		const { 
			id, 
			caption, 
			path,
			trigger = 'click' 
		} = Astro.props

```

##### id

Each TabPanelItem requires a unique identifier to prevent collisions with others on the same page.

##### caption

The caption is a string displayed within the tab.

##### path

HTML markup is loaded from the backend via a custom endpoint specified by the path prop.    

To implement this hyperComponent in your project, you will need to create a route which will respond with the html markup to be displayed in the content area of this control.

##### trigger

This prop takes the event(s) which will activate an individual tab.  

The default value is 'click'.   You can override the default value with  triggers such as `mouseenter` or `load`	depending on the needs of your application.  For multiple trigger events use a comma separated string.

Since only one tab can be activated at a time, be careful not to overload the trigger props so they interfere with each other.


	#### Styling

	```js
	import {tw} from './TabPanel.astro'
	```

	Styling for each TabPanelItem is the essence of simplicity.   All the styles are simply imported from the place where they are used which is the [TabPanel](#tabpanel) parent container.

	This unique strategy allows for rapid prototyping typical of Tailwind utility classes while also allowing access to these choices across multiple related components.

	The [TabPanel](#tabpanel) container uses most of these  TW classes to switch the appearance of active and inactive tabs.

	At the same time, exporting these styles and then importing them into the child component (TabPanelItem) shares the styling in such a manner  that changes made in the parent are propogated to the children.

  You could just destructure the properties of the `tw` constant that are used in the child component, but the coding syntax used above is just plain simple and stable.


	#### Slots

	There are no slots in this component

	#### Events

	The TabPanelItem only emits a single custom event when the `<button>` element is clicked.

	##### activateTab(tab:me)

	This custom event is emitted when the `<button>` element is clicked.   The target of this event is the parent `div.tab-panel` which in turn listens for this event and switches the active Tab to the one passed as the argument.

	#### Attributes

	```js title="Attributes"  "hx-trigger" "hx-get"
		hx-trigger={trigger}
		hx-get={`${path}`}
	```

	##### hx-trigger

The default trigger event (`click`) is set on the parent but can be overridden in each child [TabPanelItem](#tabpanelitem) by passing a different event(s) to the `trigger` prop which is then referenced by the `hx-trigger` attribute in the markup.

	##### hx-get

	This attribute tells [htmx](http://htmx.org/) which AJAX request to emit and the corresponding XHR verb (which is 'GET' in this case).

	A custom endpoint is provided to the `hx-get` attribute via the `path` prop.  

	When the trigger event occurs, [htmx](http://htmx.org/) sends an HTTP-GET request to the corresponding path and the resulting html markup is placed into the DOM according to the `hx-target` and `hx-swap` attributes on the parent [TabPanel](#tabpanel) container which are available via inheritance.

##  Usage
	{/* Discuss use cases */}
	There are many situations where TabPanels are useful.

	One common use case is illustrated by this  very  site where different source code blocks are presented in separate tabs.   

	For library documentation sites, TabPanels are frequently used to offer different language implementations of the same source code allowing the user to grab the code for their favorite language.
