A utility control for displaying content within separate panels is the TabPanel control.

In this example, classic rounded tabs utilize a button which retrieves a hypermedia fragment from a backend API route using htmx.    Panel switching is performed exclusively by HyperScript.   All styling is from Tailwind.

There are two Astro components used to provide this control, a TabPanel component which wraps multiple TabPanelItem components.   

You can style the active and inactive tabs using Tailwind utility classes and they will be picked up and implemented by the Hyperscript code.

		 
## Example
		 
export const tw = {
		exampleContainer: 'not-content w-full w-max-lg text-center mx-auto bg-gray-300 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-xl my-6',
		exampleTitle: 'bg-gray-300 dark:bg-sky-900 text-gray-300 dark:text-zinc-200 font-semibold py-2 mb-4 rounded-t-xl',
		icon:'inline-block size-6',
		image: 'inline-block max-h-6',
		p: 'pb-3'	
}
		 
<div id='TabPanel-example' class={tw.exampleContainer} >
<div id='TabPanel-title' class={tw.exampleTitle}>Sample TabPanel Control</div>
	{/* Example Control in Action */}

import TabPanel from '../../../../components/tabs/TabPanel.astro'

## Components
	{/* Breakdown of each Astro Components used for this control */}
	### TabPanel
   
	  The main container for this control is the `TabPanel` component.

		Multiple TabPanelItems are passed into the default slot of the `TabPanel` component.

		Included in the TabPanel component is a tw constant containing all the base styles for both the container, the `<output/>` panel, and the individual TabPanelItems visible at the top of the control.

		Exporting the tw constant allows for sharing key styles between the hyperscript code within the container and the tabs themselves.  In order to switch the appearance of the Tabs when activated, the styles must be available to both the container which harbors the Hyperscript code for switching tabs and the individual tab components themselves.  This is done by simply exporting a tw constant from the container and importing it into the TabPanelItem component where some of the utility classes are used to style the tabs themselves.

		#### Props
			{/* Each component, with code block showing the props interface */}
			
		```js title="TabPanel.astro"
		interface Props {
			defaultTabId?:string 
			maxHeight?:string  
		}
		
		const {
			defaultTabId = '0',
			maxHeight = 'max-h-[35rem]'
} = Astro.props 
		```
		#### Styling
		
		All of the Tailwind utility classes are encapsulated into a local constant in the Astro Component Script and then referenced in the markup.  

		In addition, these classes are shared by both the Hyperript code and the children TabPanelItem component.   This is necessary in order for the HS code to add/remove classes when the Tabs are clicked.   

		Below is the tw constant containing the entire styling code for both the container and the individual tabs.   By exporting this constant and then importing into the TabPanelItem, all the Tailwind styling is avaible to the intended markup where it is needed.

		Another advantage of this strategy is code maintenance.  It is easier to make changes and update the styling when everything is gathered into one place, but still in proximity to the markup where it is being used (as per Locality of Behavior).

		In other hyperComponents in this library, props can be used to pass in utility classes in order to customize the component from outside (i.e. where it is being used). The tailwind-merge utility is used to make sure there are no collisions between duplicate tw classes.   However, when exporting a constant in an Astro file,  the twMerge() method as concatenating any values passed in props will not work (an undefined error occurs).

		Thus, this control cannot be styled from outside.  However, it is still easy and straightforward to make any adjustments you wish to the components themselves to suit your own project needs.  Simply change the default styles listed below and test the results.

		```js
		export const tw = {
			container: 'tab-group flex justify-left ',
			output: 'block text-left p-4 w-full overflow-y-scroll ' +
				'bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-950 ',
			tabItem: 'z-10 tab-item select-none ' + 
				'font-semibold rounded-t-xl cursor-pointer ' + 
				'hover:bg-orange-100 dark:hover:bg-purple-900 ' +
				'border-2  border-slate-600 ',
			activeLight: 'bg-gray-100',
			activeDark: 'dark:bg-gray-950',
			inactiveLight: 'bg-slate-300',
			inactiveDark: 'dark:bg-gray-800',
			textActiveLight: 'text-blue-950',
			textActiveDark: 'dark:text-orange-200',
			textInactiveLight: 'text-blue-900',
			textInactiveDark: 'dark:text-zinc-200'
}
		```
		The `container` styles affect the entire control.  The `tab-group` class is added specifically to make the Hyperscript aware of parent container.  

		The `output` styles affect the content shown within the panel.  You can also apply styles separately to any markup you return from the API used to feed the panel.

		To change the appearance of the active Tab, you should adjust the  `activeLight`, `activeDark`, `textActiveLight` and `textActiveDark` properties of the tw object.

		To change the appearance of the inactive tabs, you should likewise adjust the `inactiveLight`, `inactiveDark`, `textInactiveLight`, and `textInactiveDark` properties of the tw object.

		The hover effect is added to the `tabItem` property only so that is where you would adjust any hover colors you wish.

    The Hyperscript is aware of the tw properties and will add/remove classes that already exist in the tw style object above.  If you need more customizable behaviors for the individual tabs, you may need to provide more classes to the HS code yourself.  Visit the Code section below to review the Hyperscript in the parent TabPanel component where all these actions are taking place.


		#### Slots
		{/* Outline the name/function of each slot */}
		The TabPanel has a single default slot which is intended to receive multiple TabPanelItem components as shown in the example above. 

		Each TabPanelItem is comprised of a button whose styling resembles a Tab and whose htmx attributes retrieve a hypermedia response from a custom API endpoint which you specify.   

		#### Events
		{/* Any custom events emitted by this component*/}

		The TabPanel component does not emit any custom events.  However, the HS code listens for the following events:
		
		##### load

		On page load, the defaultTabId prop is picked up by the HS code and used to identify the appropriate Tab which is then activated.   This sets the background and text color to the active styles listed above, and retrieves the content to be displayed in the panel using htmx.

		##### activateTab(tab)

		This event adds/removes classes to change the appearance of the tab which is passed as the argument.   All other Tabs under control of the container are then deactived by calling deactivateSiblings.

		##### deactivateSiblings(activeTab)

		Since only one Tab can be activated (and its content displayed) at a time, this event is used to revert all other tabs back to their initial appearance by switching certain tw utility classes.

		The `activeTab` argument is used to ignore the currenlty active tab when inactive all the others.


		#### Transitions
		{/* Description of the animations used in the control */}

		By adding `transition:true` to the `hx-swap` attribute, the ViewTransitions API is invoked to create a smooth fade-in appearance when the panel content is switched.


		#### Code
		{/* Brief explanation of the component */}

		One power feature of htmx is attribute inheritance.   Some hx-attributes can be placed on a parent element and still apply to all the children, saving code duplication. 

		Notice in the markup below, the `hx-trigger`, `hx-target`, and `hx-swap` attributes are placed onto the parent.   However, clicking a child component (i.e. TabPanelItem) still invokes the actions of these attributes.  However, repeating these attributes on every TabPanelItem becomes unnecessary because of attribute inheritance.   

		Also notice the use of back-ticks to allow string interpolation into the Hyperscript code itself.  By removing the script into a local constant and then using back-ticks with string interpolation, it is possible to embed the strings for individual TW utility classes into the HS code while at the same time allowing the markup to utilize the same classes.  

		You could not cross-purpose the styling with the HS code if you kept the TW classes inside the `class` attribute of the DOM elements themselves.

		Also note how the `maxHeight` prop is concatenated into the `class` attribute of the `<output/>` element.   This simple technique permits props to be used in the styling as long as you don't pass a duplicate class via props.   In this case, no default `max-h` as specified in the `tw.output` property used to style the `<output/>` element, so no collision would occur.   If need be, collisions or duplicates can be suppressed by using the `twMerge()` function illustrated in other hyperComponent examples.
