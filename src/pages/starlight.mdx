	{/* Introduction */}
A common interface component used primarily in blog sites is the Read More control.  This control is comprised of a button which toggles the display of a hidden content area.  The control is comprised of a button which toggles the display of the hidden content and an indicator icon which rotates to indicate the open/closed state of the control.
		 
## Example
		 
	export const tw = {
		exampleContainer: 'not-content w-full pb-4 w-max-lg text-center mx-auto bg-gray-300 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-xl my-6',
		exampleTitle: 'bg-gray-300 dark:bg-sky-900 text-gray-300 dark:text-zinc-200 font-semibold py-2 mb-4 rounded-t-xl',
		icon:'inline-block size-6',
		image: 'inline-block max-h-6',
		p: 'pb-3'	
	}
		 
	<div id='Read More-example' class={tw.exampleContainer} >
	<div id='Read More-title' class={tw.exampleTitle}>Sample Read More Control</div>
	{/* Example Control in Action */}
</div>

## Props
	{/* Each component, with code block showing the props interface */}
## Styling
To improve readability, the Tailwind classes and Hyperscripts are both extracted from the markup and encapsulated into  Astro `tw` and `hs` local variables within the [Component Script](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/#the-component-script) which are then referenced in the html markup. 
		 
The advantage of this strategy is to allow long run-on strings to be formatted as concatenated, multi-line strings which aids readability and code maintenance.
