	<p><a href="http://htmx.org">HTMX</a> is a small JavaScript library which extends the actions available to html elements.  In particular htmx provides a suite of attributes which can be added to any html element in order to
		enable server requests and target responses triggered by any event.</p>
	<p>HTMX extends the core concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia">hypermedia</a> exchanges between client and server by allowing</p>

	<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
		<li>Any element to issue HTTP requests</li>
		<li>Any event can trigger an HTTP request</li>
		<li>Any HTTP verb (not just GET or POST) can be used</li>
		<li>Any event may trigger an HTTP request</li>
		<li>Any HTTP response may be targeted to any element</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To utilize <a href="http://htmx.org">HTMX</a> on the client side, all that is needed is script tag to the CDN source code. </p>
	<p>Any HTML element can issue HTTP requests to the server by including any of the following attributes</p>
	<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
		<li>hx-get</li>
		<li>hx-post</li>
		<li>hx-put</li>
		<li>hx-patch</li>
		<li>hx-delete</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The server must respond with  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia">hypermedia</a> instead of JSON.   
		Fully constructed HTML fragments sent by the server (plus HTMX specific headers) allow
		the browser to selectively update any part of the DOM using the response  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia">hypermedia</a>.
